# Configurations

ðŸš¨ __This repo is still a work in progress and could just go away__ ðŸš¨

A mix of dotfiles and configuration files. This repo is meant to follow [XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

As such this repo should be cloned into you your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, which by default should be __~/.config__ in *nix systems.
